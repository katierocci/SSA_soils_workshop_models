Code for two soil biogeochemistry models, Millennial (https://github.com/rabramoff/Millennial) and MIMICS (https://github.com/katierocci/MIMICS_STODE/tree/MIMICS-tutorial), in same directory structure to faciliate use with AFSIS dataset.

Run_Models_AfSIS.Rmd will runs both models with the AfSIS data and create some comparison plots. The "ODEs" folder has the differential eqautions that make up Millennial (derivs_V2_MM.R) and MIMICS (RXEQ.R). The "parameters" folder has parameters for Millennial (soilpara_in_fit.txt) and MIMICS (MIMICS_parameters_sandbox_20231129.R). The "functions" folder has other functions that are needed to run Millennial and MIMICS. For Millennial, run_functions.R defines functions for running Millennial in a transient way and to steady state. For MIMICS, calc_Tpars.R calculates final parameters to be used in RXEQ.R and MIMICS_calc_steady_state_pools.R determines steady state values.
